# Project 4: Tweet-Based Identification of Power Outages


## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to improve upon current processes that identify power outages; by leveraging social media to decrease the amount of time it takes for emergency management professionals to become aware of an outage, response times can be improved.
 

## Executive Summary
### Background:
Twitter is a widely used social-media platform that allows its users to publicly post 280-character messages (140-characters prior to November 2017) on virtually any topic one can imagine. Many of these messages are simply reports of users' reactions to current events, or user statuses during those events. Accordingly, there are a large number of messages, called tweets, generated when widely disruptive events, including power outages, occur.
